To clear the VC code error "could not import syscall/js", we have to change vs code settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings
2. Select Workspace (not user), so that the changes be applicablefor this folder only, not for all GO projects
3. Search "go tools env"
4. Under "Go: Tools Env Vars" click "Edit in settings.json" 
5. Write below in the json:

{
  "go.toolsEnvVars": {
    "GOOS": "js",
    "GOARCH": "wasm",
  }
}

6. Open "Command Pallet" and "reload window"
